				<h1>We're DBMods!</h1>
				<p>
					Hello there! We're the Dropbox forum Super Users, better known as DBMods! The service has tons of users, and we have the honor of being the small group of people that get to moderate the forums.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our organization here's nothing much, but it's a little place for us to work on and share our Dropbox-Related projects with the world.
				</p>
				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>
					We create a few repos for small projects here and there, and it might be worth it to check them out!
				</p>
				<h3><a href="https://github.com/DBMods/dropbox-wallpapers">Dropbox Wallpapers</a></h3>
				<p>
					Here, you will find 3 different collections of Dropbox-themed wallpapers in both regular and lite versions, with 5 collections total. There are a variety of resolutions in each collection, and they're just the thing if you like wallpapers.
				</p>
				<h3><a href="https://github.com/DBMods/forum-mod-icons">Forum Mod Icons</a></h3>
				<p>
					This little script is a Greasemonkey plugin for the forums. It started out as a little joke between us that did nothing more than an animated Nyan Cat icons to the forum Super Users, since we don't get icons. It has since evolved into so much more, including theming, post drafting, post highlighting, and more.

				<h2>The Crew</h2>
				<h3>Andy Yasger (<a href='https://gtihub.com/TechGeek01'>@TechGeek01</a>)</h3>
				<p>
					Hey there! I'm the newest of the Super Users here, but I've been quite active on the forums since early 2012. I'm a big contributor to this organization here as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, I typically enjoy visiting with family or friends, or programming. I also manage a tech blog over at <a href='http://techgeek01.com' target='_blank'>TechGeek01.com</a>, where I occasionally post about various aspects of technology.
