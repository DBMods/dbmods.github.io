The service has tons of users, and we have the honor of being the small group of people that get to moderate the forums.\r\n\r\nOur organization here's nothing much, but it's a little place for us to work on and share our Dropbox-Related projects with the world.\r\n\r\n#Projects\r\nWe create a few repos for small projects here and there, and it might be worth it to check them out!\r\n\r\n##[Dropbox Wallpapers](dropbox-wallpapers)\r\nHere, you will find 3 different collections of Dropbox-themed wallpapers in both regular and lite versions, with 5 collections total. There are a variety of resolutions in each collection, and they're just the thing if you like wallpapers.\r\n\r\n##[Forum Extender Plus](forum-extender-plus)\r\nThis little script is a Greasemonkey plugin for the forums. It started out as a little joke between us that did nothing more than an animated Nyan Cat icons to the forum Super Users, since we don't get icons. It has since evolved into so much more, including theming, post drafting, post highlighting, and more.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
